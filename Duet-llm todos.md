## Completed

- [x] Anthropic API integration (Claude Haiku/Sonnet/Opus support)
- [x] Visual mode with pygame (comic-style speech balloons)
- [x] Conversational style tuning (brevity, casual tone, no essay-speak)
- [x] New casual personas: Jamie (pragmatic optimist) & Riley (skeptical romantic)
- [x] Response filtering (removes bracketed meta-commentary from output)
- [x] Ambient listening with Whisper (microphone captures speech, influences conversation)
- [x] Topic persistence (topics hold for N turns with reinforcement nudges)
- [x] Topic queue (new topics queue up instead of replacing immediately)
- [x] Room persona (whispering room that relays overheard topics)
- [x] MarkerFelt comic font for visual mode
